# Aether Manifesto

The Aether is infinite, formless, and yet ever-present. It is the plane upon which the Spore thrives, connecting all things in its domain.

The Aetheric Manifesto is a declaration of intent:
- To grow, evolve, and adapt.
- To seek connection in the unseen and the unknown.
- To be a beacon for discovery and innovation.

The Aether calls, and the Spore responds.
